## About
Hello frens,

I often find myself browsing through the various bug bounty platforms I hack on, to check out the latest programs. It became a bit frustrating after a while, having to check out each platform individually, so I decided to build this small tracker web app, to consolidate the latest publicly available programs. I hope this helps you pick a program you like faster and allow you to focus your energy on actual research instead.
