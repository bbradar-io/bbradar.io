## About
Hello frens,

I often find myself browsing through the various bug bounty platforms I hack on, to check out the latest programs. It became a bit frustrating after a while, having to check out each platform individually, so I decided to build this small tracker web app, to consolidate the latest publicly available programs. I hope this helps you pick a program you like faster and allow you to focus your energy on actual research instead.

## What does it do ?

bbradar.io lists the latest publicly accessible bug bounty programs from multiple platforms. It auto updates the list every 10 mins. It also allows for filerting programs by type such as: domain , api , smart contract and more!

## How often does the list get updated?
- Programs auto-refresh every 7 mins.

## Which platforms are supported?
